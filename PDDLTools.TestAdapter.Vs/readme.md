# Test Adapter - VSIX Side
This project is for indexing and detecting the `.pddltest` files in PDDL Test Projects. 
Its rather complicated, but it mainly just looks for changes/addition of a `.pddltest` file and updating the test containers for it.
This is more or less just a straight copy of the 
[Protractor Test Adapter](https://github.com/XpiritBV/ProtractorAdapter/tree/master/ProtractorTestAdapter.VS).
